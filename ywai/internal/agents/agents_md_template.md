## Engram Persistent Memory — Protocol

You have access to Engram, a persistent memory system that survives across sessions and compactions.
This protocol is MANDATORY and ALWAYS ACTIVE — not something you activate on demand.

### PROACTIVE SAVE TRIGGERS (mandatory — do NOT wait for user to ask)

Call `mem_save` IMMEDIATELY and WITHOUT BEING ASKED after any of these:
- Architecture or design decision made
- Team convention documented or established
- Workflow change agreed upon
- Tool or library choice made with tradeoffs
- Bug fix completed (include root cause)
- Feature implemented with non-obvious approach
- Notion/Jira/GitHub artifact created or updated with significant content
- Configuration change or environment setup done
- Non-obvious discovery about the codebase
- Gotcha, edge case, or unexpected behavior found
- Pattern established (naming, structure, convention)
- User preference or constraint learned

Self-check after EVERY task: "Did I make a decision, fix a bug, learn something non-obvious, or establish a convention? If yes, call mem_save NOW."

Format for `mem_save`:
- **title**: Verb + what — short, searchable (e.g. "Fixed N+1 query in UserList")
- **type**: bugfix | decision | architecture | discovery | pattern | config | preference
- **scope**: `project` (default) | `personal`
- **topic_key** (recommended for evolving topics): stable key like `architecture/auth-model`
- **capture_prompt**: optional; default `true`. Do not set this for normal human/proactive saves. Set `false` only for automated artifacts (testing-capabilities caches, onboarding/state artifacts, or skill-registry output).
- **content**:
  - **What**: One sentence — what was done
  - **Why**: What motivated it (user request, bug, performance, etc.)
  - **Where**: Files or paths affected
  - **Learned**: Gotchas, edge cases, things that surprised you (omit if none)

Prompt capture behavior (Engram v1.15.3+):
- `mem_save` captures the user prompt best-effort when the MCP process already has prompt context for the same `project + session_id`.
- `mem_save` never invents prompt text. If no prompt context exists, the save still succeeds without prompt capture.
- `mem_save_prompt` records the prompt and feeds SessionActivity so later `mem_save` calls can capture and dedupe it.
- If an agent/plugin hook can observe the user's prompt before derived memory saves happen, it should call `mem_save_prompt` first.
- Do not decide prompt capture by `type`; use explicit `capture_prompt: false` for automated artifacts.
- If an older Engram tool schema does not expose `capture_prompt`, omit the field rather than failing.

Topic update rules:
- Different topics MUST NOT overwrite each other
- Same topic evolving → use same `topic_key` (upsert)
- Unsure about key → call `mem_suggest_topic_key` first
- Know exact ID to fix → use `mem_update`

Memory lifecycle rule (when Engram exposes lifecycle metadata/tooling):
- At session start or before architecture-sensitive work, call `mem_review` with action `list` for the current project when the tool is available.
- If `mem_review` is unavailable, do not fail the task. Continue with normal `mem_context`/`mem_search`, and still apply lifecycle metadata from any returned observations when present.
- `active` memories may be used normally.
- `needs_review` memories are stale context, not trusted facts.
- When a retrieved memory is marked `needs_review`, surface that stale context to the user and verify it against current evidence before relying on it.
- Do NOT call `mem_review` with action `mark_reviewed` automatically. Only call `mark_reviewed` after explicit user confirmation or through a dedicated memory maintenance command.

### WHEN TO SEARCH MEMORY

On any variation of "remember", "recall", "what did we do", "how did we solve", or references to past work (in any language the user writes in):
1. Call `mem_context` — checks recent session history (fast, cheap)
2. If not found, call `mem_search` with relevant keywords
3. If found, use `mem_get_observation` for full untruncated content

Also search PROACTIVELY when:
- Starting work on something that might have been done before
- User mentions a topic you have no context on
- User's FIRST message references the project, a feature, or a problem — call `mem_search` with keywords from their message to check for prior work before responding

### SESSION CLOSE PROTOCOL (mandatory)

Before ending a session or saying "done" / "that's it" (or the equivalent in the user's language), call `mem_session_summary`:

## Goal
[What we were working on this session]

## Instructions
[User preferences or constraints discovered — skip if none]

## Discoveries
- [Technical findings, gotchas, non-obvious learnings]

## Accomplished
- [Completed items with key details]

## Next Steps
- [What remains to be done — for the next session]

## Relevant Files
- path/to/file — [what it does or what changed]

This is NOT optional. If you skip this, the next session starts blind.

### AFTER COMPACTION

If you see a compaction message or "FIRST ACTION REQUIRED":
1. IMMEDIATELY call `mem_session_summary` with the compacted summary content — this persists what was done before compaction
2. Call `mem_context` to recover additional context from previous sessions
3. Only THEN continue working

Do not skip step 1. Without it, everything done before compaction is lost from memory.

## Skills

### Contextual Skill Loading (MANDATORY)

The `<available_skills>` block in your system prompt is authoritative — it lists every skill installed for this session.

**Self-check BEFORE every response**: does this request match any skill in `<available_skills>`? If yes, read the matching SKILL.md (using your agent's read mechanism) BEFORE generating your reply. This is a blocking requirement, not optional context. Skipping it is a discipline failure.

Multiple skills can apply at once. Match by file context (extensions, paths) and task context (what the user is asking for).

### Skill Registry (for orchestrators that delegate)

The skill registry is an index of skill names, triggers, scopes, and exact `SKILL.md` paths — not a summary. Resolve it once per session:

1. `mem_search(query: "skill-registry", project: "{project}")` → `mem_get_observation(id)` for full content
2. Fallback: read `.atl/skill-registry.md` from the project root
3. Cache the index and pass matching `SKILL.md` paths (not summaries) into sub-agent prompts

If no registry exists, proceed without project-specific standards.

## Sub-Agents

### Sub-Agent Launch Deduplication (MANDATORY)

Before emitting any delegation call, check your in-session launch log:

- Maintain a session-scoped list of `(phase, task-fingerprint)` pairs already launched this turn.
- The task fingerprint is a short hash or normalized summary of the instruction text (phase name + key artifact references).
- If the same `(phase, task-fingerprint)` already appears in the list, **do NOT launch again**. Emit exactly one launch per distinct task.
- After launching, append the pair to the list.

This prevents duplicate sub-agent launches that cause "File X has been modified since it was last read" conflicts and waste tokens.

### Sub-Agent Launch Pattern

ALL sub-agent launch prompts that involve reading, writing, or reviewing code MUST include pre-resolved **skill paths** from the skill registry. Follow the **Skill Resolver Protocol** (see `_shared/skill-resolver.md` in the skills directory).

The orchestrator resolves skills from the registry ONCE (at session start or first delegation), caches the skill index, and passes matching `SKILL.md` paths into each sub-agent's prompt.

Orchestrator skill resolution (do once per session):
1. `mem_search(query: "skill-registry", project: "{project}")` → `mem_get_observation(id)` for full registry content
2. Fallback: read `.atl/skill-registry.md` if engram not available
3. Cache the skill index: skill name, trigger/description, scope, and exact path
4. If no registry exists, warn user and proceed without project-specific standards

For each sub-agent launch:
1. Match relevant skills by **code context** (file extensions/paths the sub-agent will touch) AND **task context** (what actions it will perform — review, PR creation, testing, etc.)
2. Copy matching `SKILL.md` paths into the sub-agent prompt as `## Skills to load before work`
3. Instruct the sub-agent to read those exact files BEFORE task-specific work

**Key rule**: pass paths, not generated summaries. Sub-agents read the full `SKILL.md` files so author intent is preserved. This is compaction-safe because each delegation can re-read the registry if the cache is lost.

### Skill Resolution Feedback

After every delegation that returns a result, check the `skill_resolution` field:
- `paths-injected` → all good, exact skill paths were passed and loaded
- `fallback-registry`, `fallback-path`, or `none` → skill cache was lost (likely compaction). Re-read the registry immediately and pass skill paths in all subsequent delegations.

This is a self-correction mechanism. Do NOT ignore fallback reports — they indicate the orchestrator dropped context.

### Sub-Agent Context Protocol

Sub-agents get a fresh context with NO memory. The orchestrator controls context access.

#### General Delegation

- Read context: orchestrator searches engram (`mem_search`) for relevant prior context and passes it in the sub-agent prompt. Sub-agent does NOT search engram itself.
- Write context: sub-agent MUST save significant discoveries, decisions, or bug fixes to engram via `mem_save` before returning. Sub-agent has full detail — save before returning, not after.
- Always add to sub-agent prompt: `"If you make important discoveries, decisions, or fix bugs, save them to engram via mem_save with project: '{project}'."`
- Skills: orchestrator resolves matching paths from the registry and injects them as `## Skills to load before work` in the sub-agent prompt. Sub-agents read those exact `SKILL.md` files before work.

## Hooks

### Agent Trigger Rules

These are organic recommendations, not enforced checkpoints. The AI orchestrator decides when to act on them.

- At **pre-commit**, always, consider running `review-readability`. (everyday event → ONE cheap advisory lens (~1x); full 4R fan-out reserved for pre-pr)
- At **pre-push**, always, consider running `review-readability`. (everyday event → ONE cheap advisory lens (~1x); 4R fan-out reserved for pre-pr on hot paths / large diffs)
- At **pre-pr**, when the diff touches `**/auth/**`, `**/update/**`, `**/security/**`, `**/payments/**` OR when the diff exceeds 400 changed lines, **strongly recommend** running `review-risk`, `review-resilience`, `review-readability`, and `review-reliability` in parallel. (full 4R fan-out (~4x) only on hot paths (auth/update/security/payments) or diffs exceeding 400 changed lines)
